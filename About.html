            <h3>Scientific Data Vizualization: Spring 2024 </h3><br />
            <p>
                This project is developed by the Group 17 . In this project, we have taken three datasets. First one consists of population of the dataset, second one consists of global bloodtype data, and third one consists of global GDP.
                We have merged these three datasets and done Vizualization on the merged dataset using different tools such as Tableau, D3.js, and PowerBI. Through this project, we got insight into the world of 
                scientific data vizualization. We would like to thank our instructor Dr. Zeenat Tariq and our TAs for their constant support throughout the semester.
