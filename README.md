# Data-visualization-project
Overview:
Led a data-driven visualization project to uncover insights into global socio-economic patterns by integrating diverse datasets from medical, demographic, and economic domains. The project focused on analyzing population statistics, blood type distributions, and GDP sector compositions across countries.

Objectives:

To explore how population, health indicators (like blood type distribution), and economic factors (GDP by sector) interact globally.

To present these insights through interactive, user-friendly visualizations across multiple platforms.

To compare tools like Tableau, Power BI, and d3.js for their effectiveness in data storytelling.

Data Sources:

Population by Country (2020) – Included attributes like total population, land area, density, and urban population.

Global Blood Type Distribution – Provided blood group data per country linked to medical demographics.

GDP Sector Composition – Covered GDP breakdown by agriculture, industry, and services for each country.

Data Engineering:

Merged datasets on the common “Country” attribute.

Performed data cleaning and imputation to ensure consistency and remove redundancies.

Created an enriched, unified dataset representing the intersection of demographic, health, and economic domains.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Tableau: Created dynamic dashboards including stacked bar charts, symbol maps, and packed bubble charts to showcase trends in urban population, net migration, and GDP components.

Power BI: Developed interactive reports using scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts to analyze fertility rates, land area vs. population, and regional disparities.

d3.js (via VizHub): Implemented custom visualizations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Created responsive pie and bar charts for population comparisons among top countries.

Deliverables:

A comprehensive web page hosting all visualizations and allowing user interaction.

Multiple dashboards across platforms to demonstrate comparative insights using different visualization tools.

A visual workflow diagram explaining the end-to-end data integration and analysis process.

Key Takeaways:

Demonstrated proficiency in using modern visualization tools and programming libraries.

Showcased the value of merging heterogeneous datasets for multi-dimensional analysis.

Enabled audiences to interpret complex data intuitively across medical, economic, and demographic metrics.
